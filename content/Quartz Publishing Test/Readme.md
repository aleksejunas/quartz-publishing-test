# My Journey with Quartz and Obsidian Publishing

## Overview

Welcome to my repository! This is a reflection on my experiences working with Quartz for publishing my content and Obsidian as my main tool for knowledge management. Over time, I've been able to create a streamlined process for writing, organizing, and publishing my notes, ideas, and content for the public. Below, I'll walk you through my experiences, challenges, and my plans for the future as I continue this publishing journey.

## My Experiences

### 1. **Getting Started with Quartz**
   Quartz has been an incredibly powerful static site generator, tailored to making my notes publicly accessible. Initially, I was drawn to its minimalistic design and the ease of setting up a personal site. However, the real beauty lies in its simplicity when working with Markdown files. With just a few commands and adjustments, I was able to take my local notes and instantly transform them into a clean, navigable website.

   Some early challenges included:
   - Understanding the folder structure of Quartz.
   - Learning how to sync changes with Git and GitHub.
   - Customizing the theme to reflect my personal style.

   These challenges, though minor, helped me become more comfortable with Git workflows and static site generation.

### 2. **Obsidian as My Main Knowledge Management Tool**
   I have been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for quite some time now, and it's easily one of my favorite tools for knowledge management. The way it handles Markdown files, its flexibility with backlinks, and its vast plugin ecosystem made it the perfect tool for managing my thoughts and notes. With Obsidian, I could organize information in a way that was not only efficient but also visually appealing, thanks to its graph view.

   **Key features I love in Obsidian:**
   - **Backlinks and the Graph View**: Being able to see connections between ideas was a game-changer.
   - **Markdown support**: The seamless integration with plain text means my notes are portable and future-proof.
   - **Plugins**: I’ve explored various plugins to enhance my workflow, from advanced searching to note versioning.

   The only real issue I faced was integrating my Obsidian workflow with a publishing platform. This is where Quartz stepped in.

### 3. **Combining Obsidian with Quartz for Publishing**
   Using Obsidian to write and Quartz to publish has made my process incredibly efficient. My workflow usually looks like this:
   1. Draft content in Obsidian.
   2. Utilize the folder structure and metadata to manage notes and ensure everything is well-organized.
   3. Sync notes via Git to Quartz.
   4. Deploy my Quartz site to GitHub Pages, where the content is automatically published.

   This integration has allowed me to focus more on writing and less on the technical aspects of publishing. The combination of these two tools helped me create a knowledge management and publishing workflow that suits my needs perfectly.

## Plans Moving Forward

### 1. **Enhancing the Site with Customization**
   Moving forward, I plan to dig deeper into customizing my Quartz site. While the current theme is functional and clean, I want to add more personal touches:
   - Custom CSS to reflect my branding and style.
   - A more robust homepage showcasing my top posts or notes.
   - Better integration with social media for sharing insights.

### 2. **Exploring Other Static Site Generators**
   Although Quartz has been a fantastic tool, I want to explore other options as well, such as Hugo or Jekyll, to see if they offer additional features or a more streamlined deployment process. Exploring these platforms will also help me understand the broader landscape of static site generation.

### 3. **Publishing More Regularly**
   One of my goals is to establish a consistent publishing cadence. I’ve had success with sporadic publishing, but I believe I can provide more value by creating a regular schedule. My aim is to:
   - Post at least one article/note per week.
   - Focus on topics like personal growth, tech, knowledge management, and productivity.
   - Use Obsidian’s daily note feature to build up a pipeline of ideas.

### 4. **Automating the Publishing Workflow**
   While the current sync process is fairly straightforward, I’d like to automate it even further. I’m considering integrating:
   - **GitHub Actions**: For automated builds and deployments when new content is pushed.
   - **Obsidian Plugins**: To directly export notes to a ready-to-publish format with metadata included.

### 5. **Creating a Knowledge Hub**
   My long-term goal is to turn this site into a comprehensive knowledge hub that not only documents my personal growth and learning but also serves as a resource for others interested in productivity, knowledge management, and personal development.

## Conclusion

This repository represents not just my public-facing content but also my journey toward mastering the tools that make publishing easy. Quartz and Obsidian have been pivotal in helping me organize, document, and share my knowledge effectively. I’m excited to continue evolving this workflow and seeing where it takes me.
